# Marketplace partners

GitLab supports automation for selected distribution marketplaces to process sales of GitLab products to authorized
channel partners. Marketplace partners can use the GitLab Marketplace APIs to integrate their systems with GitLab to
sell GitLab subscriptions on their site.

This document's target audience is third-party developers for Marketplace partners.

## How the Marketplace APIs work

The Marketplace APIs are hosted in the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/). The Customers Portal allows
individual customers to purchase and manage GitLab subscriptions and supports APIs for partners
to make sales on behalf of their customers. The Customers Portal integrates with other GitLab services, including
Zuora and Salesforce, to provide a task-oriented interface for users.

The following example shows a typical purchase flow of request and response between the following components:

- Customer
- Marketplace partner system
- Customers Portal
- Zuora
- Salesforce

    participant Marketplace partner system

    Customer ->> Marketplace partner system: Place order to purchase GitLab subscription
    Marketplace partner system ->> Customers Portal: Get OAuth token
    Customers Portal ->> Marketplace partner system: Access token
    Marketplace partner system ->> Customers Portal: Place order
    Customers Portal ->> Zuora: Create Zuora subscription
    Customers Portal ->> Salesforce: Create Salesforce objects
    Zuora ->> Customers Portal: Success response with Zuora subscription data
    Customers Portal ->> Marketplace partner system: Success response with order ID
    Zuora ->> Customers Portal: Zuora callout event
    Customers Portal ->> Customer: send license notification
    Marketplace partner system ->> Customers Portal: Poll order status
    Customers Portal ->> Marketplace partner system: Success response with order status
```

## Prerequisites

Before a marketplace partner client can use the Marketplace API, GitLab must set up the following configurations for the client:

1. Client credential. Marketplace APIs are secured with OAuth 2.0. A client credential is required to get the OAuth token.
1. Invoice owner account in Zuora system. Required for invoice processing.
1. Distributor account in Salesforce system.
1. Trading partner account in Salesforce system.

Interested GitLab Partners should contact their GitLab Partner Manager or email [`partnerorderops`](mailto:partnerorderops@gitlab.com).
