# Import a project from GitLab.com to your self-managed GitLab instance (removed) **(FREE ALL)**

WARNING:
The GitLab.com importer was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/108502) in GitLab 15.8
and removed in GitLab 16.0. To import GitLab projects from GitLab.com to a self-managed GitLab instance use
[migrating groups and projects by direct transfer](../../group/import/index.md#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended).
