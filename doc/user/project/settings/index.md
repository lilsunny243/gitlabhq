  Users with access to the metrics dashboard can also access environments and deployments.

## Configure merge request settings for a project

Configure your project's merge request settings:

- Set up the [merge request method](../merge_requests/methods/index.md) (merge commit, fast-forward merge).
- Add merge request [description templates](../description_templates.md).
- Enable:
  - [Merge request approvals](../merge_requests/approvals/index.md).
  - [Status checks](../merge_requests/status_checks.md).
  - [Merge only if pipeline succeeds](../merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.md).
  - [Merge only when all threads are resolved](../merge_requests/index.md#prevent-merge-unless-all-threads-are-resolved).
  - [Required associated issue from Jira](../../../integration/jira/issues.md#require-associated-jira-issue-for-merge-requests-to-be-merged).
  - [GitLab Duo Suggested Reviewers](../merge_requests/reviews/index.md#gitlab-duo-suggested-reviewers)
  - [**Delete source branch when merge request is accepted** option by default](#delete-the-source-branch-on-merge-by-default).
- Configure:
  - [Suggested changes commit messages](../merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.md#configure-the-commit-message-for-applied-suggestions).
  - [Merge and squash commit message templates](../merge_requests/commit_templates.md).
  - [Default target project](../merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.md#set-the-default-target-project) for merge requests coming from forks.

### Delete the source branch on merge by default

In merge requests, you can change the default behavior so that the
**Delete the source branch** checkbox is always selected.

To set this default:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Merge requests**.
1. Select **Enable "Delete source branch" option by default**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Export project

You can [export a project and its data](import_export.md#export-a-project-and-its-data).

## Transfer a project to another namespace

When you transfer a project to another namespace, you move the project to a different group.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the [group](../../group/index.md#create-a-group) you are transferring to.
- You must be the Owner of the project you transfer.
- The group must allow creation of new projects.
- The project must not contain any [container images](../../packages/container_registry/index.md#move-or-rename-container-registry-repositories).
- The project must not have a security policy.
  If a security policy is assigned to the project, it is automatically unassigned during the transfer.
- If the root namespace changes, you must remove npm packages that follow the [naming convention](../../../user/packages/npm_registry/index.md#naming-convention) from the project.
  After you transfer the project you can either:

  - Update the package scope with the new root namespace path, and publish it again to the project.
  - Republish the package to the project without updating the root namespace path, which causes the package to no longer follow the naming convention.
    If you republish the package without updating the root namespace path, it will not be available at the [instance level endpoint](../../../user/packages/npm_registry/index.md#install-from-the-instance-level).

To transfer a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. Under **Transfer project**, choose the namespace to transfer the project to.
1. Select **Transfer project**.
1. Enter the project's name and select **Confirm**.

You are redirected to the project's new page and GitLab applies a redirect. For more information about repository redirects, see [What happens when a repository path changes](../repository/index.md#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes).

NOTE:
If you are an administrator, you can also use the [administration interface](../../../administration/admin_area.md#administering-projects)
to move any project to any namespace.

### Transferring a GitLab SaaS project to a different subscription tier

When you transfer a project from a namespace licensed for GitLab SaaS Premium or Ultimate to GitLab Free:

- [Project access tokens](../../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md) are revoked.
- [Pipeline subscriptions](../../../ci/pipelines/index.md#trigger-a-pipeline-when-an-upstream-project-is-rebuilt)
  and [test cases](../../../ci/test_cases/index.md) are deleted.

## Archive a project

## Delete a project

> - Default deletion behavior for projects changed to [delayed project deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32935) in GitLab 12.6.
> - Default deletion behavior for projects changed to [immediate deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220382) in GitLab 13.2.
> - Default deletion behavior for projects on the Premium and Ultimate tier changed to [delayed project deletion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389557) in GitLab 16.0.
> - Default deletion behavior changed to delayed deletion on the Premium and Ultimate tier [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

You can mark a project to be deleted.
After you delete a project:

- Projects in personal namespaces are deleted immediately.
- Projects in groups are deleted after a retention period.

Prerequisite:

- You must have the Owner role for a project.

To delete a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the **Delete this project** section, select **Delete project**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, enter the project name and select **Yes, delete project**.

This action deletes the project and all associated resources (such as issues and merge requests).

You can also [delete projects using the Rails console](../working_with_projects.md#delete-a-project-using-console).

### Delayed project deletion **(PREMIUM ALL)**

> - [Enabled for projects in personal namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/89466) in GitLab 15.1.
> - [Disabled for projects in personal namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95495) in GitLab 15.3.
> - Enabled delayed deletion by default and removed the option to delete immediately [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

Projects in a group (not a personal namespace) can be deleted after a delay period.

On self-managed instances, group administrators can define a deletion delay period of between 1 and 90 days.
On SaaS, there is a non-adjustable default retention period of seven days.

You can [view projects that are pending deletion](../working_with_projects.md#view-projects-pending-deletion),
and use the Rails console to
[find projects that are pending deletion](../working_with_projects.md#find-projects-that-are-pending-deletion).

### Delete a project immediately

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/191367) in GitLab 14.1.
> - Option to delete projects immediately from the Admin Area and as a group setting removed [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

If you don't want to wait for delayed deletion, you can delete a project immediately. To do this, perform the steps for [deleting a projects](#delete-a-project) again.

In the first cycle of deleting a project, the project is moved to the delayed deletion queue and automatically deleted after the retention period has passed.
If during this delayed deletion time you run a second deletion cycle, the project is deleted immediately.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for a project.
- You have [marked the project for deletion](#delete-a-project).

To immediately delete a project marked for deletion:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. In the **Delete this project** section, select **Delete project**.

## Troubleshooting

When working with project settings, you might encounter the following issues, or require alternate methods to complete specific tasks.

### Transfer a project through console

If transferring a project through the UI or API is not working, you can attempt the transfer in a [Rails console session](../../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).

```ruby
p = Project.find_by_full_path('<project_path>')

# To set the owner of the project
current_user = p.creator

# Namespace where you want this to be moved
namespace = Namespace.find_by_full_path("<new_namespace>")

Projects::TransferService.new(p, current_user).execute(namespace)
```
