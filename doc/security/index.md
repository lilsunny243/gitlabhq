To harden your GitLab instance and minimize the risk of unwanted user account creation, consider access control features like [Sign up restrictions](../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md) and [Authentication options](../topics/authentication/index.md). For more detailed information, refer to [Hardening](hardening.md).

Self-managed GitLab customers and administrators are responsible for the security of their underlying hosts, and for keeping GitLab itself up to date. It is important to [regularly patch GitLab](../policy/maintenance.md), patch your operating system and its software, and harden your hosts in accordance with vendor guidance.
