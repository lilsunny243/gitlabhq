# Rate limits on Git SSH operations **(FREE SELF)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78373) in GitLab 14.7 [with a flag](../feature_flags.md) named `rate_limit_gitlab_shell`. Available by default without a feature flag from 15.8.

GitLab applies rate limits to Git operations that use SSH by user account and project. When the rate limit is exceeded, GitLab rejects
further connection requests from that user for the project.

The rate limit applies at the Git command ([plumbing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)) level.
Each command has a rate limit of 600 per minute. For example:

- `git push` has a rate limit of 600 per minute.
- `git pull` has its own rate limit of 600 per minute.

Because the same commands are shared by `git-upload-pack`, `git pull`, and `git clone`, they share a rate limit.

Users on self-managed GitLab can disable this rate limit.

## Configure GitLab Shell operation limit

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/123761) in GitLab 16.2.

`Git operations using SSH` is enabled by default. Defaults to 600 per user per minute.
