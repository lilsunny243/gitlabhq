# Deprecation terms

## Deprecation

- Required before ending support for a feature or removing a feature.
- Feature not recommended for use.
- Development restricted to Priority 1 / Severity 1 bug fixes.
- Will be removed in a future major release.
- Begins after a deprecation announcement outlining an end-of-support or removal date.
- Ends after the end-of-support date or removal date has passed.

## End of Support

- Optional step before removal.
- Feature usage strongly discouraged.
- No support or fixes provided.
- No longer tested internally.
- Will be removed in a future major release.
- Begins after an end-of-support date has passed.

[Announcing an End of Support period](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#announcing-an-end-of-support-period)
should only be used in special circumstances and is not recommended for general use.
Most features should be deprecated and then removed.

## Removal

- Feature usage impossible.
- Feature no longer supported (if End of Support period hasn't already been announced).
- Happens in a major release in line with our
  [semantic versioning policy](../policy/maintenance.md).
- Begins after removal date has passed.

## Breaking change

A "breaking change" is any change that requires users to make a corresponding change to their code, settings, or workflow. "Users" might be humans, API clients, or even code classes that "use" another class. Examples of breaking changes include:

- Removing a user-facing feature without a replacement/workaround.
- Changing the definition of an existing API (by doing things like re-naming query parameters or changing routes).
- Removing a public method from a code class.

A breaking change can be considered major if it affects many users, or represents a significant change in behavior.
