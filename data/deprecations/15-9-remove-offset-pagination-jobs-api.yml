    A request to the API for `/api/v4/projects/:id/jobs` can return a paginated list of jobs. Projects can contain hundreds or thousands of jobs, so using an offset to paginate through them is slow. Users should instead use [`keyset-based pagination`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/rest/index.html#keyset-based-pagination) when requesting consecutive pages of results.

    In milestone 16.0 we will remove offset-based pagination.
