    GitLab follows an [annual upgrade cadence for PostgreSQL](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/data_stores/database/postgresql-upgrade-cadence.html).

    Support for PostgreSQL 13 is scheduled for removal in GitLab 17.0.
    In GitLab 17.0, PostgreSQL 14 becomes the minimum required PostgreSQL version.

    PostgreSQL 13 will be supported for the full GitLab 16 release cycle.
    PostgreSQL 14 will also be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 17.0.
