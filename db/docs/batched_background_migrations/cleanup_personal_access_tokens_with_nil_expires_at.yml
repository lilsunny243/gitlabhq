migration_job_name: CleanupPersonalAccessTokensWithNilExpiresAt
description: Updates value of expires_at column to 365 days from now when it's nil for PersonalAccessTokens
  Originally introduced via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/120239
  Re-ran because there was a bypass that enabled some new PATs to be created with nil expires_at. That bypass was patched via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/121370.
